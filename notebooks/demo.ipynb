They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid\\'s original rules.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\\n\\nGameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\\n  \\n     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\\n\\nEach mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\\n\\nThe second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\\n\\nAs a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\\n\\nVictory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.

Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that\\'s not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn\\'t good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\\n\\nWhen you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \"beanometer\" for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.\\n\\nThe original German edition supports 3-5 players.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\\n\\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player\\'s turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\\n\\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition\\'s value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\\n\\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\\n\\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40.

With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.\\n\\n', yearpublished=1972, minplayers=2, maxplayers=2, playingtime=60, minage=12, usersrated=None, average=None, rank=4181, categories=['Age of Reason', 'American Indian Wars', 'Wargame'], mechanics=['Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Simulation'], designers=['Steve Brewster', 'Tom Dalgliesh', 'Lance Gutteridge'], artists=[], publishers=['Columbia Games', 'Gamma Two Games']),\n",

On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\\n\\nSet-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\\n\\nA turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.\\n\\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.\\n\\n\", yearpublished=1995, minplayers=3, maxplayers=4, playingtime=120, minage=10, usersrated=None, average=None, rank=603, categories=['Economic', 'Negotiation'], mechanics=['Chaining', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Income', 'Market', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Race', 'Random Production', 'Take That', 'Trading', 'Variable Set-up'], designers=['Klaus Teuber'], artists=['Volkan Baga', 'Tanja Donner', 'Pete Fenlon', 'Jason Hawkins', 'Eric Hibbeler', 'Michaela Kienle', 'Andreas Klober', 'Harald Lieske', 'Michael Menzel', 'Marion Pott', 'Quentin Regnes', 'Andreas Resch', 'Matt Schwabel', 'Franz Vohwinkel', 'Stephen Graham Walsh'], publishers=['KOSMOS', '64 Ounce Games', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'asmodee', 'Astrel Games', 'BGA Plus', 'Br\u00e4dspel.se', 'Brain Games', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Capcom Co., Ltd.', 'Catan Studio', 'Competo / Marektoy', 'danspil', 'Descartes Editeur', 'Devir', 'Dexy Co', 'Enigma (Bergsala Enigma)', 'Eurogames', 'Filosofia \u00c9ditions', 'Galakta', 'Giochi Uniti', 'GP Games', 'Grow Jogos e Brinquedos', 'HaKubia', 'Hanayama', 'Hobby World', 'Ideal Board Games', 'Igroljub', 'IntelliGames.BG', '\u00cds\u00f6ld ehf.', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames', 'L&M Games', 'Laser plus', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Logojogos', 'Mayfair Games', 'MIPL', 'NeoTroy Games', 'Ninive Games', 'Paper Iyagi', 'Piatnik', 'Rozum', 'Smart Ltd', 'Spilbr\u00e6t.dk', 'Stupor Mundi', 'Super Impulse', 'SuperHeated Neurons', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Tilsit', 'Top Toys', 'TRY SOFT', 'Venner\u00f8d Forlag AS'])])"
