{"id": 1, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Die Macher", "description": "Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\n\nThe 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1986, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 240, "minage": 14, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 489, "categories": ["Economic", "Negotiation", "Political"], "mechanics": ["Alliances", "Area Majority / Influence", "Auction / Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "designers": ["Karl-Heinz Schmiel"], "artists": ["Bernd Brunnhofer", "Marcus Gschwendtner", "Harald Lieske"], "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "Moskito Spiele", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "Portal Games", "Spielworxx", "sternenschimmermeer", "Stronghold Games", "Valley Games, Inc.", "YOKA Games"]}

The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.\n\nHistory of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\n\nMany books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of \"Vacations\" from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called \"ACQUIRE.\" 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.\n\nDecember 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition\n1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & stocks with printed backs\n1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)\n1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)\n1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)\n1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board\n1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company\n1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       & 86)\n1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)\n1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions\n1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro\n1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks & money, large info cards\n2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast\n2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

{"id": 10, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Elfenland", "description": "Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\n\nGameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\n  \n     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\n\nEach mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\n\nThe second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\n\nAs a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\n\nVictory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1998, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 1487, "categories": ["Fantasy", "Travel"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Network and Route Building", "Open Drafting", "Point to Point Movement", "Programmed Movement", "Turn Order: Progressive"], "designers": ["Alan R.

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.\n\nOn a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the \"fields\" in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\n\nWhen you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \"beanometer\" for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.\n\nThe original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\n\nSet-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\n\nA turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points.

The actions are:\n- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, \n- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or \n- to roll and move again and also collect points.\n\nThe action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.\n\nA new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. \n\nIn RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\n\nIn general, players will first fill all of their robot's \"registers\" with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\n\nRobots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\n\nThe game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\n\nUPC 742818050029\n\n", "yearpublished": 1994, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 639, "categories": ["Maze", "Miniatures", "Racing", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Bias", "Grid Movement", "Lose a Turn", "Modular Board", "Programmed Movement", "Race", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "designers": ["Richard Garfield"], "artists": ["Peter Bergting", "Bob Carasca", "Phil Foglio", "Daniel Gelon", "Jennifer Lathrop", "Paul Sottosanti", "Franz Vohwinkel", "Peter Whitley"], "publishers": ["Wizards of the Coast", "999 Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "AMIGO", "Avalon Hill", "Hasbro", "Play Factory"]}

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.\n\nWacky, Wacky West re-make description:\n\nFans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter&Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.\n\n\nJust south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair & Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call \"Wacky Water!\" \n\n\nNow that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: \"no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...\" Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....\n\n\nIn Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes!

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.\nTo this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.\n\nAs a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.\n\nMAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.\nThe complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.\n\nBetween exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises.

{"id": 42, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Tigris & Euphrates", "description": "Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris & Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\n\nStarting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris & Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \"ziggurat expansion\", initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\n\nSome versions of Tigris & Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

{"id": 50, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Lost Cities", "description": "Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30.

The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.\n\nPaths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.'

Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.\n\nWhile the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1995, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 100, "categories": ["Medieval"], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Area Majority / Influence", "Auction / Bidding", "Hand Management", "Open Drafting", "Selection Order Bid", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Take That", "Turn Order: Auction"], "designers": ["Wolfgang Kramer", "Richard Ulrich"], "artists": ["Doris Matth\u00e4us", "Stefan Sonnberger", "Franz-Georg St\u00e4mmele"], "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "999 Games", "Anv\u00e4ndbart Litet F\u00f6retag", "Descartes Editeur", "Devir", "Feelindigo", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Gabinete L\u00fadico", "Game Harbor", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Giochi Uniti", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lucky Duck Games", "MINDOK", "M\u00f6bius Games", "Rio Grande Games"]}

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.\n\nThe second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.\n\nThe components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.\n\n\nNote that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.

There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player.

The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.\n\nOnce a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected.

(Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards. When the deck runs out, play one final round, then score your cards in hand.\n\nIf you have 200 or more in a single currency, score that many points. If you have less than 200 in a currency, subtract 100 from that amount but don't go below 0. If you have all three 20s or 30s in a currency, score 100 points in addition to whatever the currency itself scores for you. Sum these amounts, along with whatever coins you have in hand.

{"id": 128, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Take it Easy!", "description": "It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. \"The 9-8-7,\" for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.\n\nThe idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.\n\nTake It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1983, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 20, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 2435, "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Puzzle"], "mechanics": ["Bingo", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Peter Burley"], "artists": ["Peter Burley", "Alexander Strohmaier", "Steve Tolley", "Franz Vohwinkel", "Thomas Weiss"], "publishers": ["Burley Games", "F.X.

Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards.\n\nIn addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.\n\nThe 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.\n\nPit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse', a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.

{"id": 171, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Chess", "description": "Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side of the board. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes that defeat is inevitable and ends the game), or one of several types of draws.\n\nChess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. The 2020 Netflix series, The Queen's Gambit was enjoyed by both chess players and non-players alike. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. Chess is so well known and highly regarded that it is often used as a metaphor in journalism, poetry, fiction, and film.\n\nChess has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, which became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians.

However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.\n\nThe game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent \"fear\" that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included \"spiders\" and \"Wesley Snipes.\")\n\nIn the basic game, each player controls two sous-chefs; on each turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both sous-chefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest sous-chef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a sous-chef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling sous-chef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and third-place chefs can beat a player with a first-place and a dead (non-scoring) chef.\n\nVariants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 sous-chef tokens for each player.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1998, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 8, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 28667, "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice", "Print & Play"], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Race", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Take That"], "designers": ["James Ernest"], "artists": ["Scott M.

Players then secretly note influence on ten politicians they hope to control during the game, indicated by a number from 1 to 10.\nGameplay is not clockwise, but proceeds phase by phase with the politician holding the relevant office performing the appropriate action by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question.  Players attempt to remove politicians opposed to their interests by purging, exiling them to Siberia or by demoting them within the Politburo.  One&rsquo;s own preferred politicians can be promoted or pardoned of their previous &lsquo;sins&rsquo;. \nBut each action a politician takes causes him (or in one case, her) to age by one or more years (a measure of the aging effect of the stress of the job). Each turn, politburo members face a health check which can result in the politician becoming ill, or even dying.  The 'older' a politician gets the more likely it is that he (or she) will become ill.\nAt the end of each turn, the Party Chief must be healthy enough to wave to the crowd at the October parade.

Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck.

There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.\n\nOn your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player.

Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.\n\nWhen you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative.

If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one.

{"id": 218, "type": "boardgame", "name": "High-Bid", "description": "Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.\n\nThese 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.\n\nEach player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.\n\nThere is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.\n\nWhen a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.\n\nAgain, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:\n\n1) Purchase properties, as described above;\n\n2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or\n\n3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.\n\nSo, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.\n\nBuyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.\n\nAs High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1963, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 25, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 14243, "categories": ["Negotiation"], "mechanics": ["Auction / Bidding", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Larry Winters", "P.

{"id": 219, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Volle H\u00fctte", "description": "Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.\n\nEach player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) & activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.\n\nWhen there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.\n\nThis is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.\n\nSo if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (\"Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool\"). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (\"This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!\"). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.\n\nAnd if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).\n\nThere are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1997, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 12861, "categories": ["Economic"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Stefan Dorra"], "artists": ["Wilfried Gebhard"], "publishers": ["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten"]}

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.\n\nBefore the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.\n\nAt any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.\n\nThen scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.\n\nAfter all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).\n\nAfter the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1991, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 270, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 1203, "categories": ["Civilization", "Ancient", "Medieval", "Napoleonic", "Post-Napoleonic", "Renaissance", "Wargame", "World War I"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Gary Dicken", "Steve Kendall", "Phil Kendall"], "artists": ["Charles S.

Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.\n\nThe game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.\n\nThe prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).\n\nVariations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1988, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 180, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 1595, "categories": ["Economic", "Exploration", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Transportation"], "mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Dice Rolling", "Movement Points", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Trading", "Variable Set-up"], "designers": ["Richard Hamblen"], "artists": ["Charles Kibler", "George I.

{"id": 232, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Serenissima", "description": "The Theme\n\nIn the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.\n\nTrade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.\n\nThe Game\n\nEach players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.\n\nIn the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered \"full\"), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).\n\nDuring the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.\n\nThe game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1996, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 2360, "categories": ["Economic", "Nautical", "Renaissance"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Trading", "Turn Order: Auction"], "designers": ["Dominique Ehrhard", "Duccio Vitale"], "artists": ["Dominique Ehrhard", "Guillaume Rohmer", "Duccio Vitale"], "publishers": ["Descartes Editeur", "Eurogames", "999 Games"]}

Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1979, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 10, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 3025, "categories": ["Ancient", "Fighting", "Racing"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Action Queue", "Betting and Bluffing", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Player Elimination", "Push Your Luck", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Don Greenwood", "Michael J.

Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power.

Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...\n\nDivide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.\n\nThe game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as \"Flank Attack\", \"Cavalry Charge\" and \"Assault\", while the defensive options are things such as \"Refuse Flanks\", \"Squares Formed\" and \"Reverse Slopes\".\n\nThe rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.\n\nThe game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1997, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 240, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 17072, "categories": ["Economic", "Napoleonic", "Negotiation", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Area-Impulse", "Simulation", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Nicolas Pilartz", "Kevin Zucker"], "artists": ["Christopher Moeller"], "publishers": ["OSG (Operational Studies Group)"]}

In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.\n\nWhen the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge.

Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other.

{"id": 280, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Neue Spiele im alten Rom", "description": "Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.\n\n(7 of the games are described below)\n\nThe Wheel of History : 2-5 players\n\nThis is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.\n\nThe Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players\n\nThis is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.\n\nMercator : 3-7 players\n\nThis game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.\n\nImperium : 3-5 players\n\nThe aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.\n\nSenator : 2-3 players\n\nYou play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.\n\nCircus Maximus : 3-5 players\n\nA simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.\n\nConsul : 2-4 players\n\nThis is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.\n\n--\n\nTranslated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.\n\nNote: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1994, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 7962, "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Game System"], "mechanics": [], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "artists": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["New Games Order, LLC", "Piatnik"]}

Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.\n\nEach Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.\n\nArmies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage.

The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy & 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.\n\nAs the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.\n\nIf the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.\n\nPuzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding.

The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.\n\nPlayers may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.\n\nA Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.\n\nEach Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.\n\nPlay of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.\n\nAfter exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.\n\nThe first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.\n\nWhen all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are \"dead-ended\", the game ends and points are tallied.\n\nPoints are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at \"7\" is declared the victor.)\n\n", "yearpublished": 1992, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 70, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 7517, "categories": ["Trains"], "mechanics": ["Network and Route Building", "Open Drafting"], "designers": ["Alan R.

It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.\n\nThe board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.\n\nIt is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.\nSee also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.\n\nGames played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar.

On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.\n\nIf you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.\n\nInstead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same.

The Advanced and Optional rules allow players to choose the levels of complexity and detail that they enjoy.\n\nTIME SCALE: One month per turn. \nMAP SCALE: Twenty-five miles per hex. \nUNIT SCALE: Corps, armies, fleets, and flotillas. \nPLAYERS: Two. \nPLAYING TIME: From two to eighteen hours, depending on the scenario and rules used.\n\n&mdash;description from the back of the box\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tScenariosIncluded in the game are three scenarios: 1941, 1942, and 1943.  The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsolidated RulebookThe Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.  This was released in GENERAL 22-4.  Then, two years later, extensive errata was released in GENERAL 24-1.  Both of these are available for download in the 'files' section below.  However, a new digital rulebook is available for download with all errata already incorporated.  This is also available in the 'files' section.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Wargame Academy Tournament RulesVarious rules are subject to interpretation.  The stated goal of the Wargame Academy is to provide a tournament rulebook where interpretive rules are explicitly stated with only one ruling.  This will enable tournament play.  Visit www.wargameacademy.org for more information and for a copy of the book.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMap ExtensionsSome players through the years desired a bit more space on the map.  To that end custom map extensions have been designed by more than one player.  The VASSAL module now has map extensions available as an option for play.  West to Berlin, Northeast to Archangel, and Southeast to Baku are all included.

{"id": 334, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Advance to Boardwalk", "description": "Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.\n\nThere are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.\n\nThe 'W' on the special die is a 'wild' color. If it was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.\n\nWhen a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.\n\nSome have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.\n\nThe game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl\u00e4nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1985, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 8, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 28550, "categories": ["Economic"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Take That"], "designers": ["Charles Phillips"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Borras Plana S.A.", "Editrice Giochi", "Parker Brothers", "Winning Moves Games (USA)"]}

The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!\n\nThe game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are \"positive\" and two are \"negative\". At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.\n\nIn the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one \"double token\" prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.\n\nAt the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is \"rare\", i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.\n\nAt the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.\n\nA player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition.

Correspondingly, the price of virgin land varies widely - either very high, or very low - because preservation of nature does not give you income, but it does get you more recognition for your troubles.\n\nThis edge between commerce and nature is rendered even more difficult for the players because at the end (at least in this game) only one pays you money. Who then possesses little at the start, and who has lost in every game, matters little, except who is the richest person at the end.\n\nEach round, players bid for tiles to lay on the island paradise. One side is a building, the other a forest. The buyer chooses which side to play on. The more forest remains, the more your buildings are worth. However, the more buildings you own, the less forest there will be. Players bid with coins in their closed fist. The highest bidder wins, however, they only pay the cost of the second highest bid.

Next, you roll the dice, which show 1-2-3-4-7-X on one dice and 1-2-3-5-6-X on the other. After your first roll, if you roll doubles, move your pawn 1, 2, or 3 spaces based on what you rolled. You then treat your dice as a two-digit number, say 31, 22, 54, or 70, with the X counting as a 0. You can stop and place your dice on the ranking chart in an empty space &mdash; it contains six spaces numbered 0-5 &mdash; or you can roll again. If you roll doubles, you advance you pawn and face the same choices. If you roll an X or two Xs, then your turn ends and you move your pawn back one or two spaces.\n\nWhen you place your dice on the ranking chart, if you place your dice on a lower-numbered space and your two-digit number is equal to or larger than dice that are on a higher-numbered space, then you bump that player's dice off the chart, which means they won't move at the start of their next turn.

It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.\n\nThere have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare & Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.\n\n\n      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that \"... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn.

Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.\n\nThe cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.\n\nCards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.\n\nDisaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.\n\nHands end when a player or partnership \"goes out.\"  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.\n\nThe game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.

{"id": 380, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Polarity", "description": "Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.\n\nOn your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.\n\nGet it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.\n\nIf a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.\n\nTo be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.\n\nIf you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.\n\nComment from the designer \"Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. & Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally.

{"id": 384, "type": "boardgame", "name": "TurfMaster", "description": "Turfmaster is a horse-racing game for two to eight players, played over a \"meet\" of three races.  The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).\n\nPlayers each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.\n\nA round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).\n\nLike a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have \"joker\" cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.\n\nThe first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.\n\nThe game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the \"DeLuxe\" version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.

{"id": 393, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Dinosaurs of the Lost World", "description": "One of Avalon Hill's family games that appeals to gamers as well.  Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!\n\n\nThis Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.\n\nSecond, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.\n\nThird-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.\n\nFourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.\n\nFinally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique &ldquo;comic book&rdquo; format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1987, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minage": 8, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 6681, "categories": ["Adventure", "Animals", "Novel-based", "Prehistoric", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Events", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Modular Board", "Open Drafting", "Race", "Trading", "Variable Set-up"], "designers": ["Mick Uhl"], "artists": ["James Talbot"], "publishers": ["The Avalon Hill Game Co"]}

Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.\n\nThe game is played in three rounds.

Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.\n\nEach double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.\n\nActivated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.\n\nThe game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.

{"id": 398, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Botswana", "description": "Botswana / Wildlife Safari was originally published  as Flinke Pinke.

Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible.

Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.\n\nfrom review by Nickjost:\nPlay begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.\n\nThere are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in \"transit\" are moved to \"orbit\". Units in \"orbit\" can be deployed to the board.

Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.\n\nThe re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:\n1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.\n2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.\n\nStimmt So! A description of this version:\nUsing mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six \ndifferent types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.\n\nAl Capone  A description of this version:\nUsing Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.\n\nOther versions/re-themes:\nAlhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas.

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.\n\nTo play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.\n\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.)

The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.\n\nAt the start of your turn, you can buy shares (up to five) and sell shares (as many as you want), then you roll dice to determine which of the four company markers you place on the board and in which region. A company marker on its own doesn't contribute to the value of a company; only groups of at least two markers count, so groups of 5, 4, 1, and 1 markers would create a value of $9,000 for each of that company's shares. If you place a marker that combines those two lone markers, then you'd have groups of 5, 4, and 3, so the share price would shoot to $12,000. If you placed that marker on its own, the share price wouldn't change. When you place a marker, you gain money equal to that company's new share price, so you have an incentive to boost a company's size &mdash; but all players receive funds equal to the difference between the old share price and new for each share they hold, so are you enriching them more than yourself?\n\nOf course, you can also place a marker to tank a company's share price. When a company's group expands to touch a smaller group, that smaller group is removed from the board, lowering the value of that company's shares (as long as the group had at least two markers) and costing everyone money equal to the loss in value. (Groups of equal size cannot touch, and you cannot place a marker to force a smaller group to touch a larger one.) To end your turn, you can again sell as many shares as you want and buy shares up to the per-turn limit of five.\n\nRemoved markers are banished from the game, not returned to the supply. Once all of a company's markers have been used, or a company's share price reaches $15,000, or all of the shares have been sold, the game ends, and players cash out all their shares to see who has the most money.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1987, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 3653, "categories": ["Economic"], "mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Dice Rolling", "Stock Holding"], "designers": ["H.

The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.\n\nWhich beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?\n\nPlayers have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!\n\nWhen a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.\n\nThe game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish.

When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own.

These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.\n\nThe Phantom (or \"Hugo the ghost\" in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nOnce the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra \"fright points\" from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught \"earns\" the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.\n\nOnce all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied.

The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.\n\nAn important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!\n\nCards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.\n\nPlayers randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called \"the stack,\" provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.\n\nThough traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1993, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 20, "minage": 13, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 167, "categories": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing", "Closed Drafting", "Deck Construction", "Hand Management", "Income", "Interrupts", "Player Elimination", "Tags", "Take That"], "designers": ["Richard Garfield"], "artists": ["Victor Adame", "Miao Aili", "Randis Albion", "Rob Alexander", "James Allen (I)", "Dave Allsop", "Scott Altmann", "Ian Edward Ameling", "Eric David Anderson", "Chris J.

You can jump over only one kangaroo at a time, but you can make multiple jumps on a turn as long as each jump is along a straight line (whether orthogonally or diagonally) and it does not pass over the billabong.

{"id": 466, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Inkognito", "description": "Game description from the publisher:\n\nThe goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!\n\nIn the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.\n\nOn a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to \"ask questions\" and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.\n\nThe first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the \"code\" indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.\n\nThere is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.\n\nThe 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves \"perfect knowledge\" before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1988, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 2376, "categories": ["Deduction", "Spies / Secret Agents"], "mechanics": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Leo Colovini", "Alex Randolph"], "artists": ["Peter Gifford", "Studio Tapiro"], "publishers": ["Ares Games", "Devir", "IELLO", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames", "MB Giochi", "MB Spellen", "MB Spiele", "MB spill", "Milton Bradley", "Oliphante", "Paper Iyagi", "Piatnik", "Planplay", "Red Glove", "Rio Grande Games", "UBO CnC", "Venice Connection", "Winning Moves Germany"]}

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nPlayers start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.\n\nOn a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.\n\nThe expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square).

By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.\n Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.\n\nThrough the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1998, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 45, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 547, "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Animals", "Arabian"], "mechanics": ["Chaining", "Connections", "Enclosure", "End Game Bonuses", "Hexagon Grid", "Hidden Victory Points", "Network and Route Building", "Variable Set-up"], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "artists": ["John Gravato", "Atha Kanaani", "Damien Mammoliti", "Scott Nicely", "Brian Schomburg", "Claus Stephan"], "publishers": ["KOSMOS", "Allplay", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Hobby Japan", "Lautapelit.fi", "PS-Games", "Silver Stars Publishing", "Wargames Club Publishing", "Z-Man Games"]}

Players navigate flying dragons from North to South to reach the Golden Volcano.  You start with a set of wind stones marked N, S, O, W, SO, and SW (Ost is German for East).  You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.\n\nOn your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.\n\nYou make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.\n\nThe main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.\n\nAlthough the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and \"Let's do it again!\"\n\n", "yearpublished": 1992, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 20461, "categories": ["Fantasy", "Racing"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Memory"], "designers": ["Wolfgang Riedesser"], "artists": ["Dewa Waworka"], "publishers": ["F.X.

You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered \"Clobbered\" and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse. Optional rules include rules for variable points for the different types of food (cheese, drumstick, apple)\n\n", "yearpublished": 2000, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": null, "categories": ["Animals", "Fighting"], "mechanics": [], "designers": ["Patrick Folan"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Those Darn Games!"]}

{"id": 521, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Crokinole", "description": "Crokinole is a traditional two- or four-player dexterity game, played on a circular wooden board, with 3 rings and an inner recessed 'bullseye'. A ring of posts is set around the inner circle, which functions as an obstacle to reach this area. Playing pieces are wooden circular disks similar to checkers pieces.  Players take turns shooting disks across the board by flicking them with their fingers in an effort to land them in the highest scoring ring on the board, the highest score (20 points) achieved by shooting a disk into the centre, recessed hole. From the outside in, rings are worth 5, 10, 15 points.\n\nAs a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.\n\nEach disk to be shot must be placed on the outer boundary and within the shooting player's quadrant. If there are no opponent's disks on the board, the shot disk must land in the inner ring or it is removed. If there is an opponent's disk on the board, the shot disk must hit an opponent's piece, either directly, or by bumping another disk into it.  Disks landing in the centre hole are removed and scored at the end of the round. Disks that lie outside--or are touching--the outer boundary after each shot are removed from play for the round.\n\nThe player to score the most points wins the round and scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A \"game\" is usually played to four rounds. The number of \"games\" in a match is set by the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, play is to a set score, usually the first player or team to 100, and each round is scored by cancellation. For example if Player One scores 250, and Player Two scores 225, then Player One will add 25 to his/her game score.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1876, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 8, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 46, "categories": ["Action / Dexterity"], "mechanics": ["Flicking", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "artists": ["Allison Litchfield", "Orlando Ramirez"], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)", "(Unknown)", "alfaset", "BrownCastle Games", "Carrom Company", "Cogitate Games", "Coleco Industries, Inc.", "Crokinole World", "Felsberger", "Ferti", "Gameland \u6e38\u620f\u5927\u9646", "Gerhards Spiel und Design", "Hilinski Brothers", "Industries Prince, Inc.", "John Jaques of London", "Korea Boardgames", "Let's Play Games!

Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:\n\na) trump colors (primary & secondary) \nb) most or fewest tricks \nc) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'\n\nBidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.\n\nAfter this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase.

Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him.

But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.\n\nThe prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't.

Each of up to four players or teams uses their own set, so there&rsquo;s no craning around to see the picture at the far end of the table. In fact, spiffy cardboard easels prop up the scenes nicely so they&rsquo;re easier to view.  Everyone loads identical scenes onto their easels and a deck of cards  provides a letter for the round. Everyone gets sixty seconds to write down as many things beginning with that letter as they can find in the scene. Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn&rsquo;t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points. When all lists have been scored everyone advances to the next scene and a new letter is chosen.

{"id": 549, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Aerodrome", "description": "Excerpted from a review by Ken Tidwell\n\nAerodrome is a miniatures game of aerial combat during World War I. Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.\n\nPilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1994, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 12, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 10705, "categories": ["Aviation / Flight", "Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War I"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue"], "designers": ["Stanley Kubiak", "Winston J.

{"id": 550, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Barbarossa", "description": "Barbarossa, in Italian \"red beard\" was, according to its inventor, inspired by Patricia McKillip's Riddle-Master fantasy trilogy (Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister in the German translation), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated \"As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.\"\n\nThe game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.\n\nYou make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.\n\nYour objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.\n\nA later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.\n\nRe-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.\n\nRepublished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1988, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 4572, "categories": ["Deduction", "Fantasy", "Humor", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Targeted Clues"], "designers": ["Klaus Teuber"], "artists": ["Bildg\u00e5rden AB", "Anders Jeppsson", "Anke Pohl", "Marion Pott", "Thilo Rick", "Bernd Wagenfeld"], "publishers": ["Alga", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten", "Catan GmbH", "DV Games", "KOSMOS", "Mayfair Games", "New Games Order, LLC", "Rio Grande Games"]}

{"id": 552, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Bus", "description": "Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.\n\nPlayers may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.\n\nBuying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.\n\nBus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 14, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 477, "categories": ["Transportation"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Action Queue", "Network and Route Building", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Turn Order: Claim Action", "Turn Order: Progressive", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Jeroen Doumen", "Joris Wiersinga"], "artists": ["Herman Haverkort", "Tamara Jannink", "Daan van Paridon", "Thijs van Paridon", "Joris Wiersinga"], "publishers": ["Splotter Spellen", "Capstone Games"]}

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.\n\nPlayers take turns as follows:\n-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)\n\n-Make \"variable\" rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any \"uninvited\" people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to \"get rid of\" them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).\n\n-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to \"call\" the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are \"uninvited\" (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for \"getting rid of\" these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be \"called\") can also be played in this round.\n\n-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)\n\n-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)\n\n-Additionally, some Life cards are orange \"Whenever\" cards which can be played at any time.\n\n-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.\n\nThe first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 13, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 10414, "categories": ["Card Game"], "mechanics": ["Set Collection", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Jon Darbro"], "artists": ["Jack Elmy", "John Kovalic", "Philip Reed"], "publishers": ["Steve Jackson Games", "Edge Entertainment", "LocWorks", "Pegasus Spiele", "Raven Distribution", "Ubik"]}

The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.\n\nFor those interested in graph theory, a key part of the Metro game design is that the routes will always connect a starting subway train station with an empty destination station, rather than routing to another starting subway train station. The tiles implement a design principle which allows any tile to be placed on any open grid space, subject to rules for alignment with existing tile edges. If correctly placed per the rules, the routing will allow for all trains to score, albeit not necessarily for the high run value the owner would like to attain.\n\nThe game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Cable Car\n\n\n", "yearpublished": 1997, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 8, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 2498, "categories": ["Trains"], "mechanics": ["Network and Route Building", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Dirk Henn"], "artists": ["Barbara Henn", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["Queen Games", "Calamity Games", "Corfix", "db-Spiele", "Devir", "G3", "Piatnik", "\u00dcberplay"]}

The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.\n\nUP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.\n\n\nUP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).\n\nRecommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 & up.\n\nEach game includes: \n\n     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;\" &times; 3 &frac12;\" playing cards\n     120 full-colour 2\" &times; 2.6\" infantry cards\n     40 full-colour 2.3\" &times; 3.1\" AFV cards (maybe 39 cards?

{"id": 593, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Favoriten", "description": "Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.\n\nFive horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.\n\nThat's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. \"I'll back the green horse\") the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.\n\nEventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).\n\nThe constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1989, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 9, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 11269, "categories": ["Racing"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing"], "designers": ["Walter M\u00fcller"], "artists": ["Wolfgang Steinmeyer"], "publishers": ["Walter M\u00fcller's Spielewerkstatt"]}

The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.\n\nA second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.\n\nPlayers track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.\n\nThe simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game.

The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.\n\nHonor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.\n\nA player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 45, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 27806, "categories": ["Card Game", "Wargame"], "mechanics": [], "designers": ["Alan R.

{"id": 611, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Ironman Football", "description": "Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.\n\nThe game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.\n        \nThe game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.\n\nAt the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.\n\nThe three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.\n\nIn addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.\n\nEvent cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.\n\nOnce you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.\n\nAt the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1995, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 180, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 19520, "categories": ["Sports"], "mechanics": ["Events"], "designers": ["Randy Moorehead"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Simulations Workshop"]}

{"id": 619, "type": "boardgame", "name": "The Bottle Imp", "description": "In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the \"price of the bottle.\"\n\nThe entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered \"trump\" and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).\n\nCards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.\n\nIn the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson is included (in both English & German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.

The Campaign Game was further altered for \"more realism\" by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3rd Edition GameThis Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.  Comprised from the 1st Edition Rulebook, Errata, 2nd Edition Rulebook, 3rd Edition Naval Rules (Official), Q&A, and Misc. released by Avalon Hill through the years, the 3rd Edition Rulebook is the definitive edition.  Also included are all official variants and optional rules.  Available now for download in the 'Files' section of this page.  This effort embraced the official work almost exclusively.  The 4th Edition will attempt to fix some of the issues in the official work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4th Edition Game Available NowThe Unofficial Mapboard, in support of the comprehensive rulebook and titled the 4th Edition Mapboard, is now available. 1st Edition Mapboard was the initial release.  Some suggestions for updates were made so that is considered the 2nd Edition (for those who used whiteout on the 4th river of Kiev).  The brand new map was the 3rd Edition.  The 4.0 version, where unofficial work is involved, is available now on the VASSAL web site as part of the module and as a PDF for printing.\n\nThe 4th Edition Rulebook is specific to the 4th Edition Mapboard and has significant unofficial work to fix various issues.  The primary focus of the 4th Edition was the new map and the Grand Campaign Game.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1980, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 180, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 3957, "categories": ["Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Simulation"], "designers": ["Mark McLaughlin"], "artists": ["Denis Dighton"], "publishers": ["The Avalon Hill Game Co"]}

They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.

These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful \"Sail Ho!\" dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.\n\nSome Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful \"Sail Ho!\" dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.

{"id": 670, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Starship Troopers", "description": "Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of Science-Fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:\n\n\"We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.\"\n\nAlthough the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:\n\n\"A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.\"\n\nWith the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as\n\n\" . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.\"\n\nIn early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.\n\nBut the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:\n\n\"The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...\"\n\nAs the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.\n\nThe game is set up in a \"Programmed Instruction\" system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. \"Flores died on the way up\") to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.\n\nWarfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race.

Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.\n\n\nMicrobadge available: \n\n", "yearpublished": 1987, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 10976, "categories": ["Economic", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["David Ladyman"], "artists": ["Mark Chandler", "Frank Kelly Freas", "C.

{"id": 699, "type": "boardgame", "name": "HeroQuest", "description": "HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons & Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop Ltd. who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book. The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.\n\nThe game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game's quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. During a Hero's turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.\n\nThe game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door, or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.\n\nAdditional material, which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion, was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1989, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minage": 14, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 696, "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Die Icon Resolution", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Role Playing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Square Grid", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Stephen Baker"], "artists": ["Gary Chalk", "Nikki Dawes", "Max Dunbar", "Les Edwards"], "publishers": ["Games Workshop Ltd.", "Milton Bradley", "Avalon Hill", "Estrela", "El Greco", "Hasbro", "Kod Kod", "MB Giochi", "MB Jeux", "MB Juegos", "MB peli", "MB spel", "MB Spellen", "MB Spiele", "MB spil (Danish)", "Takara"]}

Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\n\nThe Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.\n\nWestern nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.\n\nWar of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces.\n\nThe Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist.

Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.\n\nEach player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left \"paralyzed with fear.\"\n\nThere is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a \"Goosebumps\" space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.\n\nDuring the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a \"magic potion\" square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.\n\nOnce a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins.

Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.\n\nOver the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.\n\nThe master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl&oacute;rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.\n\nYour journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring.

The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.\n\nWhen you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew.

{"id": 827, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Attila", "description": "In 375 A.D., Attila's mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.\n\nPlayers have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.\n\nPlayers are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.\n\n", "yearpublished": 2000, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 45, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 3794, "categories": ["Ancient"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Stock Holding"], "designers": ["Karl-Heinz Schmiel"], "artists": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["999 Games", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "Rio Grande Games"]}

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.\n\nThe game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.\n\nHow difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending \"megabucks\". Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.\n\nThe winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.\n\nThis first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Illuminati Expansion Set 1\n    Illuminati Expansion Set 2\n    Illuminati Expansion Set 3\n\n\nRe-published as:\n\n    Illuminati\n\n\nCCG Version:\n\n    Illuminati: New World Order\n\n\nMagazine Articles:\n\n    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)\n        European Illuminati - New cards.\n    \n    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)\n        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.\n    \n    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)\n        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.\n    \n\n\n", "yearpublished": 1982, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 4501, "categories": ["Card Game", "Novel-based", "Political", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management"], "designers": ["Steve Jackson (I)"], "artists": ["Jeffrey D.

With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.\n\nIn more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.\n\nThird edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.\nFor its 20th Anniversary, Roads & Boats has an edition that contains the &cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition\n\n", "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 240, "minage": 14, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 702, "categories": ["City Building", "Civilization", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Transportation"], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Line Drawing", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "designers": ["Jeroen Doumen", "Joris Wiersinga"], "artists": ["Herman Haverkort", "Tamara Jannink"], "publishers": ["Splotter Spellen"]}

The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted \"tennis ball\".  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.

If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!\n\nGameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.\n\nEach turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.\n\nDuring the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.\n\nThere are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.\n\nGunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.\n\nVictory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.\n\n", "yearpublished": 2000, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 7199, "categories": ["American West"], "mechanics": ["Tile Placement", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Martin Wallace"], "artists": ["Peter Dennis"], "publishers": ["Warfrog Games"]}

The winner is the first player to complete a major, minor, and short treasure route.  Treasure Routes are diamonds, rubies, Inca Gold, Art Treasures, Mexican Silver, and money.  Play is accomplished on a dual-action board game, with movement of Jetliners on the peripheral Treasure Runway, which dictate the movement of Treasure Seekers and Treasure Couriers along the Treasure Routes on the world map in the center of the board. When a Seeker reaches a Destination Foreign City (New York to Johannesburg for Diamonds), a suitcase which is color coded to the Treasure Route (Orange for Major Routes, Gold for Minor Routes, and Grape for Short Routes) is attached to the base of the Seeker, which becomes a Treasure Courier.  The Courier then returns the Treasure (in the suitcase!) to the U.S. City of Embarkation.  When the Courier reaches the Customs 12 Mile Limit it can't move without declaring the treasure or making a smuggle attempt.  SMUGGLE cards are collected to facilitate the smuggle attempts.  Yin Yang Cards bring good fortune or bad fortune along the way. Each game has different dynamics.  Gals can square off against the guys and youngsters like to beat up on the adults!  There is interaction of players all along the Treasure Routes.  All players are in the game until it is over.  The play builds in excitement until the game-winning treasure is smuggled.

{"id": 926, "type": "boardgameexpansion", "name": "CATAN: Cities & Knights", "description": "Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\nThe game changes the base game in three main ways:\n\nFirst, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.\n\nSecond, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)\n\nFinally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1998, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 150, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": null, "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Medieval", "Negotiation"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Trading"], "designers": ["Klaus Teuber"], "artists": ["Volkan Baga", "Tanja Donner", "Jason Hawkins", "Eric Hibbeler", "Harald Lieske", "Michael Menzel", "Quentin Regnes", "Klaus Teuber", "Franz Vohwinkel", "Stephen Graham Walsh"], "publishers": ["KOSMOS", "999 Games", "Albi", "asmodee", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Brain Games", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Catan Studio", "danspil", "Devir", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "GP Games", "HaKubia", "Hobby World", "Igroljub", "\u00cds\u00f6ld ehf.", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames", "Laser plus", "Lautapelit.fi", "Mayfair Games", "MIPL", "Piatnik", "Rozum", "Smart Ltd", "Spilbr\u00e6t.dk", "SuperHeated Neurons", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Tilsit", "TRY SOFT", "Venner\u00f8d Forlag AS"]}

Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.\n\nThe board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.\n\nThe game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.\n\nFollowing an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  \nPhase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.\n\nThe twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:\n\n\n     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. \n\n\n\n     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. \n\n\n\n     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. \n\n\nOnce the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.\n\nThe game ends once the necklace is completed. The player with the most money is victorious.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1984, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 8, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 25977, "categories": ["Economic"], "mechanics": ["Auction / Bidding", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Martin Ebel"], "artists": ["Wolfgang Friedrich"], "publishers": ["Queen Games", "Edition Perlhuhn (G\u00f6ttinger Spiele)"]}

{"id": 943, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Ligretto", "description": "In Ligretto, each player has their own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are theirs. At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.\n\nPlaying at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.\n\nIf a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.\n\nAs soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.\n\nA rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1988, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 10, "minage": 8, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 3636, "categories": ["Card Game", "Real-time"], "mechanics": ["Ordering", "Pattern Building", "Real-Time", "Speed Matching"], "designers": ["Michael Michaels"], "artists": ["Michael Michaels"], "publishers": ["999 Games", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten", "Desyllas Games", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Playroom Entertainment", "Rosengarten", "Schmidt Spiele", "Tactic"]}

{"id": 949, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Twixt", "description": "Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a \"connection-type\" game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. \"Connection type\" means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.\n\nSome old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.\n\nTwixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.\n\nAfter the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.\n\nOn your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.\n\nWhen a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1962, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 2779, "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "mechanics": ["Connections", "Network and Route Building"], "designers": ["Alex Randolph"], "artists": ["(Uncredited)"], "publishers": ["3M", "Alga", "The Avalon Hill Game Co", "Dujardin", "Felsberger", "GP Games", "Klee", "KOSMOS", "Lil' Cerebral", "Schmidt International", "Schmidt Spiele", "Selecta Spel en Hobby"]}

(A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.\n\nDia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.\n\nThe first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.\n\nThe original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.\n\nNot to be confused with:\n\n     Dia de los Muertos (2007)\n     Dia de los Muertos (2016)\n\n\n", "yearpublished": 2000, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 6770, "categories": ["Card Game", "Deduction"], "mechanics": ["Team-Based Game", "Trick-taking"], "designers": ["Frank Branham", "Sandi West"], "artists": ["Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada", "Jacob Walker", "Sandi West"], "publishers": ["Jolly Roger Games", "Sacred Chao Games"]}
{"id": 951, "type": "boardgame", "name": "Football Strategy", "description": "Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line \"goal line stand\" to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for \"long gains\", the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.\n\nEach play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.\n\nFor variety, three types of offense (\"pro style\", \"aerial game\" and \"ball control\") are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.\n\nSimple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the \"More Information\" screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.\n\nFor those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.\n\n", "yearpublished": 1959, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 150, "minage": 10, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 7629, "categories": ["Bluffing", "Sports"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Memory", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Track Movement"], "designers": ["Thomas N.

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.\n\nA big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.\n\nGame play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent does have more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).\n\n", "yearpublished": 2000, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minage": 12, "usersrated": null, "average": null, "rank": 2080, "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "City Building"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Layering", "Matching", "Multi-Use Cards", "Pattern Recognition", "Resource to Move", "Set Collection", "Sudden Death Ending", "Take That"], "designers": ["Hagen Dorgathen", "Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Chris Quilliams", "Claus Schobig"], "publishers": ["KOSMOS", "999 Games", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Rio Grande Games", "Tilsit", "White Goblin Games", "Z-Man Games"]}
